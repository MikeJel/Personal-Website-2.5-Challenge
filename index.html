<h3>Similar website</h3>
<p style="color: red"> I ran into a bunch of websites that are the same core concept of mine. After insepcting the source of <a href="http://www.citypass.com/chicago/things-to-do-chicago">Citypass.com</a> I did start to recognize the HTML in it.This site blows mine out of the water. I do not have any css on mine which makes it look plain and have no UI added to it. I also see that the website is way more organized with using div I feel this is because of the CSS they use and will definitely start keeping that in mind as I go forward.
